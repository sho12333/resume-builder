# OpenNext Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Read the documentation at https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare.

## Develop

Run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or similar package manager command
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Preview

Preview the application locally on the Cloudflare runtime:

```bash
npm run preview
# or similar package manager command
```

## Deploy

Deploy the application to Cloudflare:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or similar package manager command
```

### Cloudflare Dashboard Settings

When deploying via Cloudflare Workers/Pages, use these settings:

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy`

The build command runs `opennextjs-cloudflare build` which creates the `.open-next/` directory containing the worker and assets needed for deployment.
